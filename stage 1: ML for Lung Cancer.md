# 📝 **Introduction** 
Lung cancer is a major global health problem characterized by high intra-tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. Recent advancements in cancer research, including -omics analysis and large-scale databases, have provided valuable insights. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex biomedical data, aiding in early detection, classification, prognosis prediction, and drug response evaluation. This review provides an overview of ML algorithms used in lung cancer research and highlights the challenges and opportunities for future applications.

#⚙️ **ML and its applications**
ML-powered computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems assist in analyzing imaging data to predict malignancy more efficiently than traditional CT scans. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have improved the accuracy of these systems and can detect benign and malignant nodules. ML models use omics data to uncover specific cancer types and sub-types, allowing the identification of genetic markers for diagnosing lung cancer. ML techniques enable precise predictions of lung cancer prognosis and responses to treatments. Additionally,  ML is applied to lung cancer therapy to predict treatment response, evaluate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and predict neoantigens. ML models analyze immune sequencing signatures, transcriptomic data, imaging, and radiomic features aiding in personalized treatment

# 🌐 **Challenges and Future Perspectives**
Deep Learning (DL) models particularly ViTs (vision transformers) have excelled CNNs models. Although less used in lung cancer studies, DL models have applications in population studies using recurrent neural networks-(RNNs) and CNNs. Graph neural networks -( GNNs ) and unsupervised deep clustering tools help in lung cancer studies. To overcome challenges such as platform noise and robustness, Multi-model medical segmentation networks, and transfer learning are being used. AI(XAI) is used for analysing model behaviours and is guiding clinical research. While developing ML algorithms, accuracy and under-the-curve are common metrics, specificity and sensitivity are more relevant when dealing with high-risk patients. DL Models aid in personalized therapies but face challenges with data evolution

# 📋 **Conclusion**
ML and DL are transforming lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis by integrating diverse data types, improving clinical decision-making, and laying the foundation for personalized treatment through better imaging, omics analysis, and immunotherapy predictions. These systems enhance early detection, predict therapy responses, and track patient outcomes, contributing to precision medicine in oncology. However, challenges remain, including the need for better dataset integration, improved model robustness, and generalizability across varied patient data. Despite these hurdles, the future of AI in lung cancer research holds tremendous promise for enhancing patient care and outcomes.
